#### Nutrition as a Therapeutic Tool

In the modern hospital, **nutrition** is recognized as a direct therapeutic intervention. The food services department now works hand-in-hand with clinical dietitians to provide meals tailored to specific patient needs, such as low-sodium, high-protein, or pureed diets.

Good nutrition is crucial for wound healing, boosting the immune system, and increasing patient energy levels during recovery. Poor appetite can significantly delay discharge.

##### Enhancing the Patient Experience

Many leading hospitals have adopted **room service models** similar to hotels, allowing patients to order meals on demand within dietary guidelines. This improves meal satisfaction and helps reduce food waste.

By viewing food as a critical component of treatment, hospitals are successfully improving clinical outcomes and enhancing the overall patient experience.
