#### Proactive Outreach and Prevention

Today's hospitals are increasingly recognized as **Community Anchor Institutions**. They play an active role in addressing the social factors—like housing, food security, and education—that fundamentally impact health outcomes.

This involves launching free health screenings, running chronic disease education workshops, and partnering with local charities to tackle issues that lead to preventable hospital visits.

##### Addressing Health Disparities

These programs are vital for identifying and mitigating **health disparities** within the local population. By targeting resources to the most vulnerable groups, hospitals fulfill their mission to serve the broader community and reduce the reliance on expensive emergency care.

Hospitals that actively invest in community health see healthier populations and build stronger, more trusting relationships with their neighbors.
