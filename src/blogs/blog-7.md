#### Making Safety Everyone's Priority

A strong **patient safety culture** is one where every staff member feels responsible for identifying and mitigating risks. This culture promotes transparency and encourages the reporting of near-misses.

The core principle is moving away from a punitive approach to one of **system analysis**, investigating *why* an error occurred rather than *who* made it. This allows for system-wide fixes.

##### Implementing Checklists and Huddles

Adopting simple tools, like pre-surgical **checklists** (a lesson learned from aviation), significantly reduces errors. Daily safety huddles across departments ensure risks are communicated and addressed in real-time, preventing small issues from escalating.

A mature patient safety culture is the best defense against adverse events and is essential for achieving high quality-of-care ratings.
