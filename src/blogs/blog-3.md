#### The Imperative of Sterility

Surgical Site Infections (**SSIs**) pose a serious risk to patient health and are a major quality metric for hospitals. The modern operating theatre (OT) relies on a layered strategy of **stringent protocols** and cutting-edge technology to achieve near-perfect sterility.

This includes meticulous hand hygiene, proper gowning and gloving techniques, and the use of specialized **HEPA filtration systems** to maintain air quality.

##### High-Tech Sterilization Techniques

Hospitals are now utilizing advanced sterilization methods for surgical instruments, such as plasma sterilization, which offers a safer, low-temperature alternative for sensitive equipment. Continuous environmental monitoring helps ensure protocols are consistently followed.

A key part of prevention is **antibiotic stewardship**, ensuring appropriate prophylactic antibiotics are administered and discontinued correctly.
