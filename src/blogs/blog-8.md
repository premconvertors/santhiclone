#### Harnessing the Power of Digital Data

The **Electronic Health Record (EHR)** system is the central nervous system of a modern hospital. When properly implemented and optimized, it transforms disjointed information into actionable intelligence, enhancing clinical decision support.

Effective EHR use ensures that patient histories, test results, and treatment plans are immediately available across the care continuum, drastically reducing the risk of medical errors due to incomplete information.

##### Interoperability and Patient Portals

The goal of **EHR interoperability** is seamless data exchange between different healthcare providers outside the hospital. Furthermore, patient portals empower individuals to access their own data, schedule appointments, and communicate with their care team, fostering greater patient engagement.

Continuous training and minimizing "alert fatigue" are key hospital strategies for maximizing the substantial benefits of the EHR system.
